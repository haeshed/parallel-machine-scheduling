round type (an int value 1 (for SPT) or 2 (for LPT))
machine number (an int value between 1 - n)
job number (an int value between 1 - n)
speed (a double value larger than 0) machine 0 policy (an int value between 0 - 4) if policy is 4 - a priority list of job IDs
speed (a double value larger than 0) machine 1 policy (an int value between 0 - 4) if policy is 4 - a priority list of job IDs

speed (a double value larger than 0) machine n-1 policy (an int value between 0 - 4) if policy is 4 - a priority list of job IDs
job 0 processing time (a double value between 1 - 10)
job 1 processing time (a double value between 1 - 10)

job n-1 processing time (a double value between 1 - 10)

**Attention: for the speed value - it is imperative to write as double, for example 1.0 and not 1
             This is the only diffence against a priority list that is not in the correct length
